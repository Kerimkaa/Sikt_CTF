# ctf.sikt.no SiktCTF - Capture The Flag

## üìÖ When
**Date:** 07.10.2024 - 28.10.2024

## üìù What is ctf.sikt.no?
SiktCTF is a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition, an exciting, security-focused event that invites participants to find and exploit vulnerabilities in fictional systems. The purpose of this CTF was to provide participants with hands-on experience in cybersecurity while developing skills in vulnerability analysis, cryptography, web control, and more. The challenges were designed to cater to a wide range of skill levels, from beginners to more experienced security enthusiasts. SiktCTF is organized as part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, delivered by the Norwegian Center for Cybersecurity in Research and Education (eduCSC).

## üïπÔ∏è Rules
To participate in the ctf.sikt.no CTF, participants had to follow these rules:

1. **Flag Format**: Flags follow this regex pattern: `/^SiktCTF{.*}$/`.
2. **Example of a Valid Flag**: `SiktCTF{th1s_i5_4_fl4g'+!-.@#$%?}`. All flags without this format are considered invalid.
3. **Team Size**: Teams can have up to 5 members to qualify for prizes (see prize details for more information).
4. **No DDoS Attacks**: DDoS attacks are strictly prohibited.
5. **No Brute-Forcing**: Brute-forcing on server challenges is not allowed unless explicitly permitted.
6. **No Team Collaboration**: Collaboration between different teams is not allowed.
7. **No Flag Hoarding**: Hoarding flags is not allowed.
8. **First Flag**: The first flag is commented out on this page.
9. **Final Decisions**: All decisions made by SiktCTF administrators in case of disagreements are final.

### General Rules

1. **Respect Everyone**: Treat everyone with respect; harassment of any kind is not tolerated. Contact an admin if you have concerns.
2. **Flag Sharing**: Do not post flags in any channels.
3. **No Piracy**: Sharing links to pirated software or tools is forbidden.
4. **Safe Content**: Keep all content on SiktCTF communication platforms SFW (Safe For Work).
5. **No Write-ups Before the Competition Ends**.
6. **Do Not Hack the CTF Infrastructure**.
7. **No Advertising**: Do not advertise other CTFs, Discord servers, or events without approval from an organizer or admin.

9. **Final Decisions**: Admin decisions are final in all disputes.
10. **Have Fun!**

Follow these rules for a safe and fair competition experience in SiktCTF.


## üîç Challenges
The competition consisted of several categories, including:
- **OSINT**: Use of open-source intelligence to gather information and solve challenges.
- **Web**: Challenges related to web security, including web page vulnerabilities.
- **Steganography**: Hidden information in files requiring special techniques to reveal.
- **Reverse**: Analysis and deconstruction of binary files to understand and solve logical challenges.
- **Forensics**: Analysis of digital traces and files to extract information.
- **Misc**: Various challenges that combine multiple disciplines within cybersecurity.
- **Cryptography**: Tasks related to encoding and decoding encrypted messages.
